Password security is critical in today's digital world. With the increasing number of 
online accounts, remembering unique and secure passwords for each one is 
becoming increasingly difficult. Password managers come in handy in this 
situation. Our Java project aims to provide a password management solution by 
creating a password generator, manager, and Encryptor that employs the Advanced 
Encryption Standard (AES). AES is a popular encryption algorithm noted for its 
high security.
Our password manager will allow user to make a strong password of their own 
choice and also user will able to know the strength of password generated by 
him/her.
Additionally, our password generator have the capability og generating a random 
strong password based on the requirements of the user such as length of the 
password etc., and the generated password can also ne encrypted using the AES 
encryption
